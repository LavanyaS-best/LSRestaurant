## About

This project is a collection of static HTML and CSS files. The primary goal was to practice creating interconnected web pages and to learn how to use GitHub Pages for deployment. The site includes a personal "About Me" section and a separate section for a "Foodie Place" menu, demonstrating different styling and layout techniques.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured with all the necessary files in the root directory:

- `index.html`: The homepage for the "Foodie Place" restaurant menu.
- `aboutme.html`: A detailed "About Me" page with personal information.
- `hobbies.html`: A page dedicated to hobbies and extracurricular activities.
- `info.html`: A page containing family and talent information.
- `food.css`: The CSS stylesheet for the `index.html` (Foodie Place) page.
- `aboutme.css`: The CSS stylesheet used by the personal portfolio pages (`aboutme.html`, `hobbies.html`, `info.html`).
- Image Files: Several image files (e.g., `LubuPoo.jpg`, `PizzaPoo.jpg`) are included to display content on the various pages.
